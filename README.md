This python script can create tech news video and upload directly to your youtube channel. You can host it in a server it will automatically create tech news video daily time based and upload it in your youtube channel. That mean you do not need to create video everyday. While you are sleeping your video will automatically upload in youtube. <br>

## If you want to create a tech news channel on youtube what you do?<br>
Collect news from online then some images then voice over. After that you will create intro outro and edit your final video. Then you need to manually upload a video in youtube and give title, tag, description and thumbnails.To do this thing every day you waste minimum 2 to 4 hours. IF we using this python script we save lot of time.
##  YouTube Data API (v3)<br>
We are using YouTube Data API (v3) to upload our video in youtube. Mind it youtube make your video private locked. If you are not verify your project. I need to varify my project from youtube. it take 6 day for me. To varify my project I  filled up a form to youtube and It required  my project documentation like some code, screenshot, my project id, client, location, full name etc. Now If I upload my video from YouTube Data API (v3), my video will be public not private locked.
