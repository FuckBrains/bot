^^^^Vivo V20 (2021) has allegedly been spotted on Geekbench, revealing some key possible specifications of the smartphone. The handset, that has already been certified by multiple regulators, has been listed with 8GB of RAM. The listing also suggests that the phone may run Android 11, and could be powered by SM6150, that is essentially the Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 SoC. Vivo has not officially announced anything about launching a refreshed version of the Vivo V20 yet, but previous reports have suggested the smartphone could be launched in India soon.^^^^Xiaomi Mi 11's purported screen protector suggesting a curved display has been leaked online. The screen protector also hints at a hole-punch design on the new Mi-series flagship. Earlier this month, Xiaomi confirmed the development of the Mi 11 as a successor to Mi 10. The new smartphone will be amongst the first models to carry Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC. Some recently-leaked images showed the back of the Mi 11 with a camera bump. The phone is likely to accompany Xiaomi Mi 11 Pro that could come with a large 6.76-inch display.^^^^iQoo 7 has officially been confirmed by the company as its upcoming flagship smartphone. The launch date has not yet been announced, but a teaser poster revealing design details has been shared by the company.

The phone is said to be powered by Snapdragon 460 SoC and come with a notched selfie camera. The bezels are relatively thick all around. However, at this point it is unclear if this is the image of the Moto G Play (2021) or just a placeholder. The phone was allegedly spotted in a Geekbench listing last month that also suggested the presence of Snapdragon 460 SoC.^^^^Samsung has announced that it will be unveiling a new Exynos SoC on January 12. While the post, which comes with a short teaser video, does not reveal the name of the mobile processor, it is expected to be the upcoming Exynos 2100. The new SoC will be launching two days ahead of the expected launch of the Samsung Galaxy S21 series. While a lot about the Exynos 2100 SoC is still unclear, it was spotted in a Geekbench listing recently with a high-end Samsung phone believed to be the Galaxy S21 Ultra.^^^^Samsung Galaxy S21 series European pricing has allegedly leaked ahead of its launch. A known tipster has leaked that the Galaxy S21 will be priced at EUR 849 (roughly Rs. 76,000) for the 128GB storage option. The Galaxy S21+ is said to start at EUR 1,049 (roughly Rs. 94,500) for the same storage variant and also have a higher storage variant. Pricing for the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 128GB model has also been leaked and the tipster claims that it has increased compared to the Galaxy S20 Ultra launched earlier this year.^^^^Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC has been put through a series of synthetic industry benchmark tests by the company itself. Launched earlier this month as a successor to last year's Snapdragon 865, the new SoC from Qualcomm posted impressive scores in benchmark tests including platforms such as AnTuTu, Geekbench, and more. The company usually allows third-party reviewers to have hands-on access to the latest Snapdragon reference design. However, owing to the coronavirus-induced pandemic this year, Qualcomm has collated results across leading industry benchmark testing system.^^^^Vivo X60 series, comprising Vivo X60 and Vivo X60 Pro, details have been revealed by the company through its online store. It shows both the smartphones in all their colour variants and configurations. Vivo X60 will be offered in two RAM and storage configurations while the Pro variant will come in a single storage model. The pricing or specifications have not yet been revealed, but it does state that the phones will be powered by a 5nm flagship chip, that was earlier confirmed by the company to be the Exynos 1080 SoC. Additionally, Vivo has also shared that its new OriginOS will debut with the Vivo X60 series.^^^^Samsung Galaxy S20 FE smartphones have started receiving the Android 11-based One UI 3.0 update, as per a report. The update reportedly brings with it a tweaked UI design, along with other One UI 3.0 features and the December 2020 Android security patch.

The smartphone has already been tipped to sport quad cameras on the back, and recent reports have suggested that the phone will not have a telephoto snapper as claimed previously. The report also claimed that the purported smartphone will be launched in both 4G and 5G variants. It is being speculated that the Galaxy A72 will feature a similar design as the Galaxy A52 and will be launched early next year.^^^^Samsung Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21+, and Galaxy S21 Ultra have been in the rumours for some time. But after getting leaked in some renders and videos, some clear images that are claimed to be official ones showing the next-generation Samsung phones, have now been leaked online. These newly surfaced renders show the design of the Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21+, and Galaxy S21 Ultra, which all appear to have hole-punch displays and multiple cameras along with some prominence at the back. The Galaxy S21 series also seems to have as many as four distinct colour options.^^^^OnePlus 9 series smartphones may feature Leica cameras, as per a new leak. This could mean that the upcoming phone series from the Chinese smartphone maker may get significant improvements in terms of photography, compared to its previous generation phones. Earlier reports also suggest that the company is especially focussing on the cameras for the upcoming series. An image of the alleged OnePlus 9 smartphone leaked online shows a triple rear camera setup with two large sensors and a smaller sensor.^^^^Oppo A53 5G, a 5G version of the Oppo A53 debuted back in August, has been launched in China. The phone comes with the same specifications as the original barring a few tweaks. Oppo A53 5G is offered in two RAM and storage configurations and three colour options.

The phone also features a high refresh rate display and a different processor from the original Oppo A53.^^^^Realme C20 has received certification from Thailand's NBTC authority, showing the possible moniker of the smartphone that carries model number RMX3061. The listing, however, does not reveal any other information. It is speculated to be an entry-level smartphone. Another Realme handset with model number RMX3063 is reportedly believed to belong to the same Realme C20 series. The smartphone with RMX3063 model number has previously surfaced on India's BIS regulatory body website as well as the US FCC certification site, showing a 5,000mAh battery.^^^^Samsung Galaxy Note 20 and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra have reportedly started receiving the stable version of Android 11-based One UI 3.0 in markets outside the US.

Stanford Medicine leadership has since apologized and promised to re-evaluate the plan.
“We take complete responsibility for the errors in the execution of our vaccine distribution plan,” a Stanford Medicine spokesperson said in a statement to The Verge.
We apologize to our entire community, including our residents, fellows, and other frontline care providers, who have performed heroically during our pandemic response.

But it turns out Fox had been interested in a three-dimensional Simpsons game long before that — one that could have appeared on the Sega Dreamcast if things had worked out.
Today, the DreamcasticChannel on YouTube (via Kotaku) is showcasing an unreleased tech demo from the year 2000 for a title tentatively called “The Simpsons: Bug Squad!” It’s from the long-defunct Red Lemon Studios, and it’s remarkable how much the game’s cel-shaded graphics look like the show.
Less understandable is the whole Bug Squad thing.
Hopefully, some of the original developers (or Fox executives) will come forward so we can find out.^^^^Perhaps that’s why AI has such an impact on our imagination, and why, in recent years, there’s been so much hype surrounding the technology.
Cheap processing power and abundant data have made this possible, and AI and machine learning are now useful tools in a diverse range of fields, including astronomy, health care, transportation, and music.
After years of promise, AI is finally becoming usefulAfter years of promise, AI is finally becoming useful.
Any technology destined to change the world needs scrutiny, and AI, with its combination of huge imaginative presence and very real, very dangerous failings, needs that scrutiny more than most.
So, for the AI Issue at The Verge, we’re taking a closer look at some of the ways artificial intelligence and machine learning are affecting technology right now — because it’s too late to understand something after it’s changed the world.^^^^“Alexa, play the Queen’s Christmas Day message” will soon be a thing — even if you don’t live in the UK.
Starting December 25th at 3PM GMT (or 10AM ET, 7AM PT), that phrase will deliver the Queen’s traditional Christmas Day broadcast, according to The Guardian.
If you’re curious what the Queen’s message might contain, you can check out transcripts of all her previous Christmas Broadcasts (going back to 1952!)

Amazon seems to think it might be: “After a challenging year, millions of people from across the Commonwealth will be eagerly awaiting Her Majesty the Queen’s message on Christmas Day.^^^^9to5Mac’s Michael Steeber noticed a interesting coincidence today: the company has temporarily closed every single retail store in California, many more across the US, both stores in Mexico, both stores in Brazil, and is about to close 16 additional stores across the UK.
As Steeber points out, that’s nearly 100 stores if we include ones it closed in Germany and the Netherlands last week, leaving nearly a fifth of the company’s locations now closed worldwide.
I checked Apple’s complete list of stores to confirm, and sure enough: every California store, all four in Tennessee, all three in Utah, all four in Minnesota, two in Oklahoma, and the stores in Portland, Oregon; Anchorage, Alaska; Omaha, Nebraska; and Albuquerque, New Mexico are all closed this upcoming week — as well as the 16 additional stores in the UK, Mexico and Brazil starting tomorrow, December 20th.
Apple confirmed the gist of it in a statement: “Due to current Covid-19 conditions in some of the communities we serve, we are temporarily closing stores in these areas,” the company told Bloomberg.
Yesterday, California activated its emergency alert system in the SF Bay Area for the first time since the pandemic began, sending a message directly to every phone to help people understand that a stay-at-home order is now in effect.^^^^If you read my previous post, you might have noticed a brand-new Twitter label on Trump’s latest wildly misleading tweet: “Election officials have certified Joe Biden as the winner of the U.S. Presidential election.” Yes, Twitter is now calling the election for Joe Biden on Trump’s own tweets.
Twitter tells us it’s simply an update to its existing label, designed to “reflect the latest information.”But there’s a staggering difference between this label and Twitter’s previous one, which simply said “Multiple sources called this election differently.” That left room for doubt.
Now that the Electoral College has voted, Twitter not only accepting the result, but using it to visibly challenge the president’s ongoing lie that he won the election.
Doubtful, but I wouldn’t be surprised if his tweets get a little more creative, if he vents more anger at Twitter, or both.
Here’s how Trump’s same misleading statements look on Facebook today, for comparison.^^^^It’s going to be just fine.” — President Donald Trump on COVID-19, January 22nd, 2020.

Reuters, Bloomberg and others are reporting that Apple has put Taiwanese manufacturing giant Wistron on “probation” — meaning it won’t receive any new business from Apple until it sorts things out — after the supplier was found exploiting workers at a plant in India.
There’s video:Karnataka: #Violence at iPhone production plant run by Taiwan-based #Wistron Corp at Narasapura (in Kolar district) near #Bengaluru.
The question now is whether Apple will do anything meaningful to keep its suppliers from exploiting workers now that they’re making headlines yet again.
The company has a notable history of being associated with labor violations, and a recent report suggested that Apple turns a blind eye to them even when it knows there’s a problem.^^^^YouTube did not have a great 2020, but it wasn’t driven by a never-ending whirlwind of creator chaos.

Customers in America can continue to buy and use DJI products normally,” the company said in a statement to The Verge.
DJI not only sells products to consumers, but since it is far and away the market leader, its technology is used by all sorts of companies that need drones or handheld cameras.
This is not the first time that access to Chinese drones has been targeted by the US government, usually due to security concerns.
DJI has pushed back against many of these actions, saying accusations of national security transgressions are unfounded.^^^^Cyberpunk 2077’s listing on Microsoft’s digital games store now includes a label warning of potential performance issues on Xbox One.
“Users may experience performance issues when playing this game on Xbox One consoles until this game is updated,” the warning reads.
Players have observed numerous bugs and performance issues with Cyberpunk 2077 since its launch last week, especially on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

This differs from other companies, like Amazon, which are only offering tests to employees who still have to work in a physical location, like a retail location or warehouse.
This is apparently something Google employees are interested in, as the vendor’s website crashed after going live.
According to the Wall Street Journal report, Google is paying its partner, BioIQ, $50 per test.
In the early days of the pandemic, President Trump claimed that Google would create a website and nationwide system for getting access to COVID tests.^^^^In short, the hardware appears to be a big part of Samsung’s plan to take on the highly capable iPhone 12 Pro Max.
The S21 Ultra will reportedly offer 3x and 10x telephoto cameras (72mm and 240mm equivalent focal lengths, respectively), both with optical image stabilization.
It will also get laser-assisted autofocus: something that the S20 Ultra didn’t offer but the Note 20 Ultra later introduced.
But now it’s another year, and there’s more work to be done to catch up to the iPhone 12 Pro Max.
There’s no confirmed launch date or pricing yet for the S21 Ultra, though reports point to an announcement on January 14th.^^^^Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) worked together to manipulate 737 Max recertification tests following two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, according to a damning new Senate report.

The 737 Max was rushed through development so Boeing could keep pace with rival AirbusThe 737 Max was rushed through development so Boeing could keep pace with rival Airbus, which had surprise-announced a more fuel-efficient plane in 2011.
Instead of developing a new plane from the ground up, Boeing modified the 737 NG with bigger, more fuel-efficient engines.
Some FAA investigators left tests early, while others were performed in simulators that weren’t equipped with the same software that doomed the 737 Max flights, meaning the results were meaningless.^^^^A China-based former Zoom employee is being charged with harassment for allegedly disrupting video calls commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.

Zoom says it appointed Jin after the Chinese government abruptly terminated its service and demanded it comply with local censorship laws.^^^^In October, Wisconsin denied Foxconn subsidies because it had failed to build the LCD factory specified in its contract with the state.
Documents obtained through a records request show Foxconn’s rationale: it doesn’t think it was specifically promising to build an LCD factory at all.
According to a November 23rd letter to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC), Foxconn does not think the factory specified in the contract, an enormous Generation 10.5 LCD fabrication facility, was actually a “material” part of the contract.
“Without a Generation 10.5 TFT-LCD Fabrication Facility, there is no justification, or consideration, for the enormous tax credit incentives or expense to Wisconsin taxpayers,” WEDC wrote.
“Incomplete and flawed in several respects.”But such an amendment hinges, as always, on Foxconn telling Wisconsin what it is actually building.^^^^This is a monumental moment for the Times, for sure, but also for the much-hyped and growing podcasting industry.

Microsoft isn’t going as far as Sony to fully remove the game, as the title is still listed and available on the Microsoft Store.^^^^Microsoft is bringing one of its best Teams video calling features over to Skype this week.
You don’t even need the Skype app to take advantage of Together Mode, as it works through the web version of Skype without the need for an account.
Still, it’s surprising to see a Microsoft Teams feature make its way to Skype.
Skype largely missed out on this big moment, as Microsoft has increasingly turned its focus toward Teams for video calling and collaboration.
Alongside this new Together Mode feature, Microsoft is also adding its Large Grid Mode feature to Skype so you can see everyone’s video stream at the same time.^^^^It seems like there’s no sign of tech news stopping for the holidays.
more antitrust cases brought against Google this week: one from the Texas attorney general and the other from a coalition of 38 states.
The Vergecast breaks down their arguments about Google’s alleged anti-competitive behavior around ad tech and search manipulation.
In the second half of the show, The Vergecast shift gears to a review of the latest product announcement from Apple: the AirPods Max.
Chris reviewed the new $550 headphones for the site, and he details his experience on the show — from comfortability to design and sound quality.^^^^Depending on the retailer, these might not arrive in time for the holidays, but it’s the thought that counts, right?

“Operation Snowdown,” as it’s called, lasts from December 18th to January 5th, and it adds the expected to the game, including a snowy map and free unlockables like a soldier snowman called Snowmando.
In addition to the new missions and free unlockable cosmetics, the event will also include a rotating selection of limited time game modes, starting with the return of Air Royale.
Following a massive supervillain-themed live event, the game kicked off its latest season on December 2nd, introducing new characters like the Mandalorian and Baby Yoda.
Since then, Master Chief and Kratos have joined the battle royale game, and Epic has also continued to improve Fortnite on next-gen consoles.^^^^But the main event, the Firefly Inferno, was peak cringe WWE -- and featured Randy Orton apparently burning The Fiend to death.
After a stunner to Uso from Owens, Owens scaled the ladder once more.
The highlight came as the two exchanged roll-up attempts, and then countered in and out of each others' submission holds (Carmella's Cone of Silence, Banks' Banks Statement).

The final few minutes were awesome, with Miz, AJ and McIntyre propped up on two ladders in the center of the ring.^^^^On Monday, as the Northern Hemisphere marks the beginning of winter with the solstice, we're also being treated to a rare and spectacular sight in the sky: the great conjunction.
During the show, Jupiter and Saturn, the two largest planets in our solar system, will appear very close to one another, as if they were overlapping to create a double planet.
To celebrate the first day of winter and the great conjunction occurring on the same day, Google has created an animated Doodle showing Saturn giving Jupiter a high-five as it slides on by in its solar system orbit.
A conjunction occurs when any two astronomical objects appear close together in the sky when observed from Earth.
The close alignment will be easily visible to the naked eye while looking into the southwest sky just after sunset.^^^^More powerful than the Ninja and Oster models below, NutriBullet gets the job done quickly.
NutriBullet easily takes the top spot as the best blender in our blender model battle.
Molly Price/CNET Ninja did win our best blender budget pick -- until the NutriBullet got even cheaper.
What I loved about this Oster was its Reverse Blend button, something I didn't encounter on any other test model.
It's not worth spending $200 on a blender you'll use for two occasions each year.^^^^WWEAfter a garbage year, WWE is treating us with a promising main event: On Sunday, Drew McIntyre defends his WWE Championship against AJ Styles at the TLC pay-per-view event.
It's one of two world championship TLC matches, as Roman Reigns will also defend his Universal Championship against Kevin Owens.
